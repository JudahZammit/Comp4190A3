To Run a demo and investigation of FBSP and QTD run partitionInvestigation.py



Instructions on RRTsolver.py
If you run RRTsolver.py, the solver will solve a domain with 20 obstacles and each obstacle's maximum size is 50

How do you test the RRTsolver with different number of obstacles and the maximum size of obstacle?

in the file RRTsolver.py, line 170: domain = createDomain.Domain(30, 20)

the first parameter specifies the number of obstacles and the second specifies the maximum size of each obstacle.

Plz change accordingly
