Instructions on partitionInvestigation.py:
this file will test the algorithm with different sizes and different numbers of obstacles. Therefore, it takes a 
lot of time, plz be patient....add more

Instructions on RRTsolver.py
If you run RRTsolver.py, the solver will solve a domain with 20 obstacles and each obstacle's maximum size is 50

How do you test the RRTsolver with different number of obstacles and the maximum size of obstacle?

in the file RRTsolver.py, line 170: domain = createDomain.Domain(30, 20)

the first parameter specifies the number of obstacles and the second specifies the maximum size of each obstacle.

Plz change accordingly
